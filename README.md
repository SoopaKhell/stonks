Stock market simulation game written in Nim.

Probably very buggy.

There's only two companies right now.

# How to play
From the first prompt, type `buy`, `sell`, or press Enter.

If you pressed enter, the game will progress to the next turn.

If you typed `buy`, type the name of the stock you want to buy (`nasdaq` or `aapl`). Then, specify the number of shares you want to buy. Type `max` to buy as many as you can afford.

If you typed `sell`, type the name of the stock you want to sell (`nasdaq` or `aapl`). Then, specify the number of shares you want to sell. Type `all` to sell all of your shares in that company.
